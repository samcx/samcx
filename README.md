### Software Engineer [@vercel](https://vercel.com/home)

_Eat at a local restaurant tonight._ Get the cream sauce. Have a cold pint at 4 o’clock in a mostly empty bar. _Go somewhere you’ve never been._ Listen to someone you think may have nothing in common with you. Order the steak rare. Eat an oyster. _Be open to a world_ where you may not understand or agree with the person next to you, _but have a drink with them anyways._ Eat slowly. Tip your server. Check in on your [family and] friends. Check in on yourself. _Enjoy the ride._
